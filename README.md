- SQLite or other database system
- PlantNet API key (for plant identification features)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anasdaniel/FloraFinder.git
cd FloraFinder
```

2. Install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

PLANTNET_PROJECT=all
```

8. Run database migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

9. Build frontend assets:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
# Start Laravel development server
php artisan serve

# Build and watch for frontend changes
npm run dev
```

For an even faster development workflow, you can use the built-in dev script that starts multiple services concurrently:

```bash
composer dev
```

This will run:

- Laravel development server
- Queue worker
- Laravel Pail (log viewer)
- Vite development server

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

To enable server-side rendering:

```bash
composer dev:ssr
```

## Testing

Run tests with Pest:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```

## Deployment

This application follows standard Laravel deployment practices. Here's a checklist for deployment:

1. Set appropriate production values in `.env`
2. Set `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false`
3. Configure your web server (Nginx/Apache) to point to the `public` directory
4. Make sure storage and bootstrap/cache directories are writable
5. Set up your queue worker as a system service
6. Configure SSL for secure HTTPS connections
